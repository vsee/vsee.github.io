          Before ML, I made games. During my undergrad at TU Berlin, I co-founded a small game
          development studio called <strong>Brightside Games</strong>. We built Zeit², a time-manipulation
          puzzle platformer that got published by Ubisoft and released on Steam and Xbox Live Arcade.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          Turns out building a game studio and shipping a commercial game is excellent training for
          startup life—tight deadlines, constrained resources, and figuring out how to actually finish
          things. Eventually left to pursue a PhD at Edinburgh, but the experience of taking something
          from concept to shipped product stuck with me.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4 text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-500 italic">
          The game's still on Steam if you're into indie platformers with time-bending mechanics.
