    I'm a founding engineer at <strong>Axiom</strong>, an AI startup working toward mathematical
    superintelligence. I work on building production ML systems for training and fine-tuning
    large language models on mathematical datasets.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Before startups, I spent two years at Meta's <strong>Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</strong> team
    in Menlo Park, and before that held research and teaching positions at the
    <strong>University of Edinburgh</strong>, where I worked at the intersection of machine learning
    and systems optimization.

    Originally from Berlin, I've spent the last few years in the Bay Area working across academia,
    big tech research, and early-stage startups.
