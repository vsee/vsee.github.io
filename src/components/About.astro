    I'm a founding engineer at <strong>Axiom</strong>, an AI startup working toward mathematical
    superintelligence. I build the research infrastructure and data systems that power our
    mathematical reasoning models.
  </p>

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Before startups, I spent two years at Meta's <strong>Fundamental AI Research (FAIR)</strong> team
    in Menlo Park, and before that held research and teaching positions at the
    <strong>University of Edinburgh</strong>, where I worked at the intersection of machine learning
    and systems optimization.

  <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mt-4">
    Originally from Berlin, I've spent the last few years in the Bay Area working across academia,
    big tech research, and early-stage startups.
